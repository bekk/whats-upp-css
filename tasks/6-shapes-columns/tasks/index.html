				<h2>While that's mock-ups and this is politics.</h2>
				
				<p>
					When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, 
					they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. 
					They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, 
					are good words. Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey 
					Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.
				</p>

				<p>
					The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design 
					jobs non-competitive.
				</p>

				<p>
					You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe 
					Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer 
					on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? 
					Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.
				</p>

				<p>
					My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. An 'extremely credible 
					source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.
				</p>

				<p>
					You’re disgusting. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not 
					sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems 
					with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I 
					assume, are good words. The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. 
					I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, 
					"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."
				</p>

				<div class="label-sticker">
					My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women.

				<p>
					I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. 
					It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could 
					be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? Look at that text! Would 
					anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! You could see there was 
					text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.

					An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text 
					is a fraud. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.

				<p>
					You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your 
					entire adult life. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically 
					born with. You either have it or you don't.
				</p>

				<p>
					I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me 
					– and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern 
					border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. The best taco bowls are made in Trump 
					Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, 
					and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.

							I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. We have so 
							many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. Be careful, or I will spill 
							the beans on your placeholder text.
						</p>

						<p>
							I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups 
							and this is politics, are they really so different? Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - 
							we are not keeping up with other websites.
						</p>

						<p>
							I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was.

							I like text that wasn’t captured.
						</p>
						

						<p>
							You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.

							number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. All 
							of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. I have a 10 year old son. 
							He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an 
							art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.
