# What?  

* clip-path
* shape
* columns

---
background-image: url(images/clip-path.jpg)
class: middle center

# clip-path

.circle.red.top-right[
    Experimental
  ]


???
Prevents a portion of an element from being displayed, by defining a clipping region.

In the task that follow we will be using the -webkit- prefix, to get it working in Chrome.

Think vectors to create content masks.

---

# Nettleserstøtte
  <iframe src="caniuse-clippath.html"></iframe>

???
This is an experimental technology, all the major browser excluding IE have partial support.

---
background-image: url(images/basic-shape.jpg)
class: middle center

# Clip-path: Basic Shape

???
Basic-shape functions, shapes will make use of the specified geometry-box to size and position the basic shape. 

If no geometry box is specified, the border-box will be used as reference box.

If that is unclear, I wil go over geometry-box shortly.

---
class:split
![bilde](images/clip-path-circle.jpg)

# Clip Path - Circle

## Radius 
## Optional x, y co-ordinates

```CSS
  clip-path: circle(R at x y);
```

???
A circle is created by defining a radius, and optionally x, y co-ordinates for the center of the circle,
relative to the geometry box.

---
class:split
![bilde](images/clip-path-polygon.jpg)

# Clip Path - Polygon

## Series of x y co-ordinates

```CSS
  clip-path: polygon(x y , x y, ...);
```

???
A polygon is created by specifing a series of xy co-ordinets seperated by a comma.

---
class:split
![bilde](images/clip-path-inset.jpg)

# Clip Path - Inset

## Distance from each geometry box edge

```CSS  
  clip-path: inset(t, r, b, l);
```

???
Inset defines a quatrilateral, by defining the distance from the geometry box, top, right, bottom, left respectively.

---
class:split
![bilde](images/clip-path-ellipse.jpg)

# Clip Path - Ellipse

## X Radius
## Y Radius 
## Optional x, y co-ordinates

```CSS
  clip-path: ellipse(Rx Ry at x y);
```

???
An ellipse is similar to circle where by the circle center can be optionally defined. 
It differs by requiring both an X and Y radius to be defined.

---
class:split
![bilde](images/clip-path-svg.jpg)

# Clip Path - Url

## Inline

```XML
<svg height="0" width="0">
 <defs>
  <clipPath id="my-clip-path">
   <rect y="1" x="2" width="3" height="4"/>
  </clipPath>
 </defs>
</svg>
```

## The path to a clipping element

```CSS
  clip-path: url(clip.svg#svgClip);
```

???
URL represents a reference to a clip path element. 

This could be an SVG file or an inline SVG element.

I got this to work in Chrome using an inline SVG element but not the file reference.

---
background-image: url(images/geometry-box-bg.jpg)
class: middle center

# Clip-path: Geometry-box

???
Back to geometry box I mentioned earlier

---
class:split
![bilde](images/geometry-box.jpg)

# Geometry Box

If specified in combination with a basic-shape, it provides the reference box for the basic shape.

???
Coildn't get this working reliably with clip-path in Chrome.

If specified in combination with a basic-shape, it provides the reference box for the basic shape. 

If specified by itself, it uses the edges of the specified box including any corner shaping 
(e.g. defined by border-radius) as clipping path. 

--

## content-box

???
content-box - Uses the content box as the reference box.

--

## padding-box

???
padding-box - Uses the padding box as the reference box.

--

## border-box

???
border-box - Uses the border box as the reference box.

--

## margin-box

???
margin-box - Uses the margin box as the reference box.

--

## fill-box

## stroke-box

## view-box

???
Fill-box, stroke-box and view-box are relevant to svg clip-path element.

fill-box- Uses the object bounding box as reference box.

stroke-box- Uses the stroke bounding box as reference box.

view-box - Uses the nearest SVG viewport as reference box. If a viewBox attribute is specified for the element 
creating the SVG viewport, the reference box is positioned at the origin of the coordinate system established by 
the viewBox attribute and the dimension of the reference box is set to the width and height values of the viewBox attribute.

--

```CSS
 clip-path: padding-box circle(50%);
```

???
Clip-path example all together

---
background-image: url(images/shapes.jpg)
class: middle center

#  Shape

.circle.red.top-right[
  Partial Support
]

???
Shapes is a CSS module that defines geometric shapes for use in CSS values.

Works similar to clip-path, to define shape float 

---

# Nettleserstøtte
<iframe src="caniuse-shape.html"></iframe>

---
class:split
![bilde](images/shape-outside.jpg)


# Shape-Outside

## Define the float area for a float

```CSS
  shape-outside: margin-box circle(50%);
```

???
Shape-outside - CSS property uses shape values to define the float area for a float and will cause 
inline content to wrap around the shape instead of the float's bounding box.

--

## shape-margin

```CSS
  shape-margin: 20px;
```

???
Shape-margin - The shape-margin CSS property adds a margin to shape-outside.

--

## shape-image-threshold

```CSS
  shape-image-threshold: 0.7;
```

???
Shape-image-threshold - CSS property defines the alpha channel threshold used to extract the shape using
an image as the value for shape-outside. A value of 0.5 means that the shape will enclose all 
the pixels that are more than 50% opaque

---
class:split
![bilde](images/shape-inside.jpg)

# shape-inside

## Float inline content within an element

```CSS
  shape-inside: circle(50%);
```

???
The shape-inside floats inline content within an element.

Haven't seen this working anywhere. 

Nice to have future feature.

---
background-image: url(images/columns.jpg)
class: middle center

# Columns

.circle.red.top-right[
  Partial Support
]

---

# Nettleserstøtte
<iframe src="caniuse-column.html"></iframe>

---
class:split
![bilde](images/columns-css.jpg)

# Columns

## Define column width and number

```CSS
  columns: 300px 3;
```

???
The column CSS property is a shorthand property allowing to set both the column-width and the 
column-count properties at the same time.

--

## column-width

```CSS
  column-width: 300px;
```

???
Column-width - CSS property suggests an optimal column width. The column-width is the maximum 
width a column will become before adding another column.

--

## column-count

```CSS
  column-count: 3;
```

???
Count - obvious

---
class: cols two

# Column Rule, Fill & Gap

.col[
  ## column-rule

  ```CSS
 column-rule: solid 1px #222;
  ```

  ## column-rule-style

  ```CSS
 column-rule-style: solid;
  ```

  ## column-rule-width

  ```CSS
 column-rule-width: 1px;
  ```

  ## column-rule-color

  ```CSS
 column-rule-color: #222;
  ```
]

???
Column-rule - The seperating line between columns. Define type, width and colour in one property origin
individually.

--

.col[
  ## column-fill

  ```CSS
 column-fill: balance;
  ```

  ## column-gap

  ```CSS
 column-gap: 20px;
  ```
]

???
Column-fill - Auto and Balance, auto is should be default, but Chrome seems to use balance. Balance creates 
columns of equal height. Auto would leave the last column shorter than its siblings. The container element would
need to be of fixed height.

Column-gap - is the spacing between columns.

---
class: cols three

# Column Break

.col[
  ## break-after

  ```CSS
 break-after: auto;
  ```

  ## break-before

  ```CSS
 break-before: auto;
  ```

  ## break-inside

  ```CSS
 break-inside: auto;
  ```
]

.col[
## Values

* Auto

* Always

* Avoid

* Left

* Right

* Page

* Column
]

.col[
## _

* Region

* Recto

* Verso

* Avoid-page

* Avoid-column

* Avoid-region
]

???
Break-before - CSS property describes the page, column or region break behavior before the generated box. 
If there is no generated box, the property is ignored.

Break-after - CSS property describes the page, column, or region break behavior (in other words, 
how and whether to break) after the generated box. If there is no generated box, the property is ignored.

Break-inside - CSS property describes how the page, column or region break inside the generated box. 
If there is no generated box, the property is ignored.

//////////////////////////////
Auto - Initial value. Allows, meaning neither forbid nor force, any break (either page, column or region) to be be inserted before the principle box.

Always - Always force page breaks before the principle box. This is a synonym of page, it has been kept to facilitate transition from page-break-before which is subset of this property.

Avoid - Prevent any break, either page, column or region, to be inserted right before the principle box.

Left - Force one or two page breaks right before the principle box so that the next page is formatted as a left page.

Right - Force one or two page breaks right before the principle box so that the next page is formatted as a right page.

Page - Always force one page break right before the principle box.

Column - Always force one column break right before the principle box.

Region - Always force one region break right before the principle box.

Recto - Force one or two page breaks right before the principle box so that next page is formatted as a recto page, that is a right page in a left-to-right spread or a left page in a right-to-left spread.

Verso - Force one or two page breaks right before the principle box so that next page is formatted as a verso page, that is a left page in a left-to-right spread or a right page in a right-to-left spread.

Avoid-page -  Avoid any page break right before the principle box.

Avoid-column - Avoid any column break right before the principle box.

Avoid-region - Avoid any region break right before the principle box.
